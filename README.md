# Assassin
Creating a group based assassin game!

System has central functions that include: Assigning targets to people, verifying and reassigning when a target is killed, allowing users to create and manage groups of friends, and finally keep track of victories and statistics for the game.

Mostly uses PHP, MySQL, CSS and JavaScript. No plan at the moment to make an app but might in the future.
